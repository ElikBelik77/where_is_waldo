A project inspired by [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-find-wally-neural-network-eddbb20b0b90)


## Description
Ever wanted to find waldo quickly ? this project finds waldo in images, using a pretrained and fine-tuned [faster rcnn with inception v2](https://supervise.ly/explore/models/faster-r-cnn-inception-v-2-coco-1864/overview)


## Replicate
To replicate the results, download the model, setup the pipeline.cfg and run the model with the command provided in train_command.txt

## What's next ?
Try to recognize waldo in videos and mark them in real-time.
