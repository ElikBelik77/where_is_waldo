# Where is Waldo ? 
### COVID-19 Project #2

A project inspired by ![](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-find-wally-neural-network-eddbb20b0b90)


## Description
This project finds waldo in images, using a pretrained and fine-tuned !(faster rcnn with inception v2)[https://supervise.ly/explore/models/faster-r-cnn-inception-v-2-coco-1864/overview]
The dataset is quite small, so the model overfitted quite a bit.

## Replicate
To replicate the results, download the model, setup the pipeline.cfg and run the model with the command provided in train_command.txt

## Up next
Try to recognize waldo in videos and mark them in real-time.
